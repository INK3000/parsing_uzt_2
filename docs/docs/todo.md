## ToDo

### API service

- endpoints for manage category +
- endpoints for manage subscriber +
- endpoints for manage category/{category_id}/jobs/create +
- manage bulk_creation for categories +
- **decide how manage subscribtions for user (json or relation)**

> 1\. see how the tags are made in the course, and make similar subscriptions to categories. to do this, you need to create another many-to-many model.
>
> 2\. or make subscriptions in json format.
>
> **I have to think which way is more optimized.**
